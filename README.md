#  CivicEye ‚Äî Smart Civic Issue Reporting Platform

CivicEye is a full-stack, multi-role web application designed to bridge the gap between **citizens** and **municipal departments**.  
It empowers citizens to **report civic problems** (like potholes, electricity faults, sanitation issues, etc.), while departments and administrators manage, resolve, and track these issues ‚Äî all in **real time**.
